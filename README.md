## ITU University Management System (Admin Portal)

The **Admin Side** of the Student University Management System is designed to manage users, departments, courses, classes, scheduling, and student academic workflows. It provides role-based access and permissions to ensure structured and secure management across the university.

This is the **client-side** of the admin panel, built using **React** to offer a smooth, responsive interface with real-time updates and intuitive controls for system administrators, department heads, and instructors.

- Developed using **Tailwind CSS** for a fully responsive, modern UI with a utility-first design approach.
- Used **Firebase Firestore** for database storage and **Firebase Backend Services** to manage user data, department structures, courses, enrollments, and academic records.
- Implemented **Firebase Authentication** for secure login and role-based access control across different user types.

These technologies combine to create an interactive and seamless interface for effective project collaboration.
