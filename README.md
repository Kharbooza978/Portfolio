- Developed using **Tailwind CSS** for fast, modern, and fully responsive UI with a utility-first design approach.
- Utilized **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions to ensure a polished and engaging user experience.
- Implemented **Firebase Authentication** for secure user login and signup, ensuring protected access to student data.

These technologies combine to create an interactive and seamless interface for effective project collaboration.
